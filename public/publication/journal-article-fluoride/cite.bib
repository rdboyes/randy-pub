  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: This cross-sectional study examines the dental
               caries experience of new Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) members in
               relation to enrollment from municipalities with and without
               water fluoridation. METHODS: The study population consisted of
               recruits who enrolled in the CAF between 2006 and 2017 with an
               enrollment address in municipalities with known fluoridation
               status (n = 24,552). Odontogram statistics from dental
               examinations were used to calculate the number of decayed,
               missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) and tooth surfaces (DMFS) for
               each recruit. The average difference between recruits from
               municipalities with and without fluoridation was determined
               using a linear regression model which adjusted for confounding
               by age and gender and allowed effect modification based on
               socio-economic status. RESULTS: The average recruit was male, 24
               years of age, with 5.6 DMFT and 11.6 DMFS. After adjusting for
               age and gender, recruits residing in municipalities with water
               fluoridation had lower DMFT by 0.67 (CI - 0.55, - 0.79) points
               and lower DMFS by 1.77 (- 1.46, - 2.09) points. When allowing
               for effect modification by median income quintile of the
               recruits' home census tract, the average reduction in DMFT and
               DMFS was similar in all income quintiles, with average
               reductions in DMFT ranging from 0.47 to 1.02 and average
               reductions in DMFS ranging from 1.33 to 2.70. CONCLUSION:
               Residence in a municipality with water fluoridation was
               associated with reduced caries experience in a national sample
               of newly enrolled CAF members. The benefits of water
               fluoridation were uniform across neighbourhood income and
               military rank classes.",
